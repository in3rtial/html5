<h1 id="week2">Week 2</h1>


<h2 id="DOM">DOM (Document Object Model) </h2>


<h3 id="basics"> Basics of DOM </h3>

<ul>
    <li> basis of HTML5 is that HTML, CSS, DOM and Javascript are the basic building blocks</li>

    <li> DOM provides tree-like structures that pages should follow (template of sorts)</li>

    <li> CS (Computer Science) people love trees (that they do)</li>

    <li> HTML is built on the DOM
        <ul>
            <li> root structure (&lt;html&gt;) </li>
            <li> head, body, etc...</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li> 3 parts of a well-formed document (HTML5)
        <ol>
            <li> doctype: version of HTML under use
                <ul>
                    <li> tag: &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</li>
                    <li> much simpler now in html5</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li> head: some metadata; mostly invisible to user (except title)
                <ul>
                    <li>tag: &lt;head&gt;</li>
                    <li>metadata: language, title</li>
                    <li>supporting files: javascript, styling, add-ons (dependencies)</li>
                    <li>title is the name displayed on the tab</li>
                </ul>
             </li>
             <li>body: content to display</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="validators"> Validators</h3>

<ul>
    <li>can validate the code using online parsers/checkers
        <ul>
            <li>often forget to close tags</li>
            <li>evaluation of the actual number of errors is hard (cascade of errors...)</li>
            <li>browsers often correct mistakes making mistakes invisible which is dangerous</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>looking good is no substitution for good testing</li>
</ul>


<h2 id=tagsAndSyntax> HTML5 Tags and Syntax (generics) </h2>


<h3 id="tagsBasics"> Tags basics </h3>
<ul>
    <li>tags have a beginning <x> and ending tag </x> (where x is any tag)
        <ul>
            <li> some tags are self-closing (&lt;img src="x.gif"&gt; includes all the necessary information</li>
            <li> some tags have attributes</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li> tags documentation is easily available online</li>
</ul>

    
<h3 id="display"> Display</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>important attribute of an element is its display</li>
        <li>block: take amount of width and heigh</li>
        <li>inline: take as much space as needed</li>
    </ul>
    

    <h3 id="commonTags"> Common tags </h3>
    <ul>
        <li> headings [block]
            <ul>
                <li> &lt;h2&gt;..&lt;h6&gt; </li>
                <li>can have syntax and semantics </li> 
                <li> don't juste take into account the looks, rank by importance</li>
                <li> can confuse the user </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        
        <li>
        </li>
    
    
    </ul>
    - 
    - 
    - 
- paragraphs [block]
    - <p> .. </p>
    - should only contain inline elements

- divs [block]
    - <div> .. </div>
    - generic section
    - larger than paragraph
    - lack semantics

- ordered lists [inline]
    - <ol> <li> item1 </li> <li> ... </li> </ol>

- unordered lists [inline]
    - <ul> <li> item1 </li> <li> item2 </li> </ul>


- line breaks [inline]
    - <br>
    - self-closing


<h3> Attributes
- additional information about an element
    - often facultative

- always specified in the opening of a tag (not closing)

- attributes come in pairs [key:value]


<h3> Images (example of attributes)
- <img src="frontImage.jpg" alt="front image">
- images rarely work the first time (many possible problems)
    - too big, too smal, broken link, etc.
- choose intelligent image size and naming convention to avoid common problems
- real-world would look something like <img src="logo.jpg" alt="company logo" title="..." ...>


<h3> More Attributes
- as you learn the tags, you learn their specific attributes
- some attributes are shared by all tags
    - class
        - applies special properties to groups of elements
        - to apply style over subset of elements
    - id
        - specifies a unique id to one element of the document
        - provides unique identifier
    - style
        - avoid at all cost
        - used to be popular (but with style-content separation, it makes little sense)
    - acceskey
        - shortcut key to activate an element
        - very important to accessibility
    - tabindex
        - which order people get to in the page
        - 1 is the highest priority possible (bigger tab index = smaller priority)

<h3> Special Entitites
- to display used symbols, must use special entities
    - < : &lt
    - > : &gt
    - copyright symbol : &copy
    - blank space : &nbsp
    - cent : &cent
    - & : &amp

<h3> Summary
- difference between a tag and an attribute
    - look for the <> brackets
- what two symbols end a self-closing tag
    - </x>



## Sematic Tags

<h3> How to design
- the most important step in web design is design
- need a good idea of what you want


<h3> Using semantic tags
- div used to be very popular
    - used to have different class attributes

<h3> <header>
- introductory or navigational aids
    - title
    - navigation links (wikipedia style)


<h3> <nav>
- a section of the page that link to other pages or to parts within the page

    <nav>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="overview">Overview</a></li>
            <li><a href="history">History</a></li>
        </ul>
    </nav>

- often found in the header tag


<h3> <footer>
- usually contains info such as copyright data, related documents, links to social medias
- typically at the bottom of the page, but not required!
    - won't show up at bottom if you place it elsewhere


<h3> <figure>
- more semantics (and information) than <img>
    - caption <figcaption>
    - multiple multi-media resources



## Template
- please see week2-index.html



## Images

<h3> Image Formats
- many file types are supported
    - JPEG, gif, png
    - SVG and BMP are additional options
    - file extensions must be included
- size of images is important because they are downloaded
- every image requires an HTTP Request

<h3> Image Sizes
- browser will display the image in its original size (which is usually not good)
    - quick solution is to change file or use width/height attributes

- img tag includes width and height attributes
    - breaks the style/content separation
    - can set height and width independently
    - can set both, but doesn't preserve aspect ratio
    - can also be described in percents (width = "50%")


<h3> Favicon
- can put next to the title of the page in the tab
- must go into the <head> section
- cannot be jpg or gif


<h3> Alternative text attributes
- textual alternative to non-text content
- read by screen readers
- displayed in place of image (in case it is not available)
- provides semantic meaning for search engines


<h4> Create good alt text
- accurate
- succinct
- not redundant
- no "picture of..." and the likes of it


<h3> Empty alt text
- can be alt=""
    - better than skipping the alt text at all


<h3> Summary
- careful with file extensions and file paths
- for now, style the image inside the html


## Hyperlinks (2.06)

- they create the web


<h3> Anchor links

- syntax: <a href="http://www.umich.edu">University of Michigan</a>
- <a> tag for Anchor link
- needs a hyper-reference and content
    - href is the reference of new content
    - content is the clickable part (can be text, image...)


<h3> Types of links
- absolute
    - <a href="http://intro-webdesign.com/">Web Design</a>
    - links to someone else's page
- relative
    - <a href="page2.html">Second Page</a>
    - links to a local file
    - use on own webpage to avoid having to rename
    - links should never have folders specified
        - e.g. C:/Documents/Doc1.html
- embedded references
    - link to part of the same file (sections)

<h3> Using Images as the link
- clickable component doesn't have to be text
    - <a href="http://www.redcross.org"> <img src="img/img1.png" alt="Logo"/></a>


<h3> Usability issues
- make sure that clickable link component has an informative name
- information in the image should be available to those who can't see the image


<h3> Targets
- anchors take other attributes
    - _self: default action
    - _blank: open in new tab or window (some users don't like)
    - _top and _parent


<h3> Summary
- page without links is extremely rare
- relative, absolute, internal links
- use caution with links (for accessibility)



## Multimedia (2.07)

<h3> HTML5 multimedia
- designed to avoid use of extra software/plugins for multimedia
- not fully implemented (but getting there)


<h3> Video element <video>
- uses a src attribute or embedded <source
- common attributes
    - height, width
    - autoplay
    - loop
    - controls
- text inside <video>..</video> is displayed if browser cannot support tag


<h3> Audio element <audio>
- src attribute to link to audio file (.mp3 or .wav usually)
- commmon attributes
    - autoplay, controls, loop
    - buffered
    - muted
    - volume
- set clips with #t tag
    - .ext#t=5:25 (begin:start)


<h3> Plugins
- before html5, no standard for multimedia
    - plugins were required
- some browsers might still require Flash



<h3> Accessibility issues
- make sure to provide links to plugins
- include text description and closed captioning (or otherequivalent content)
- multimedia should enhance, not distract
